# The addHoliday and removeHoliday methods in the calendar can be used to add and remove
holidays to the calendar respectively. If a calendar has any missing holidays or has a wrong holiday,
then these methods come handy in fixing the errors. The businessDaysBetween method helps find
out the number of business days between two dates per a given calendar. Let us use this method on
the us_calendar and italy_calendar as a sanity check.

 # In valuation of certain deals, more than one calendarâ€™s holidays are observed. QuantLib has
JointCalendar class that allows you to combine the holidays of two or more calendars. Let us
take a look at a working example.
